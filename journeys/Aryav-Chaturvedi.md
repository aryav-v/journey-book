The spark of my interest into programming and development was a indirect consequence of HTML classes back in my school days .<br>

Later, I began to explore various Operating Systems including Linux, hopping from one distro to another almost every week. Customizing my operating system
helped me learn <i>Lua</i>, a programming language used in various configuration files . <br>

As of today (July 2022), I am exploring various domains including Frontend Development, DevOps and Competitive Programming.
